# Ideas for Imperial College HAB Ground Station



The HAB base station is proposed to be installed on the roof of the 10 story Electrical Engineering Building at Imperial College South Kensington. 
It will be used to receive and transmit telemetry with high altitude balloons. 

## Objectives
* Safe, secure,  and College Approved installation
* High reliability - 12 month preventative maintenance cycle
* Remote controlled and managed
* Improve logistics for Wormwood Scrubs launches.  Reduce need for launch site tracking
* Support of Open HAB community by tracking balloons in UK near-space
* Establish Imperial College Base Station as a high quality and trusted monitoring station for near space activity in the UK Region.

## Applications
* To track balloons launched by the Imperial College Space Society, especially during launches from London
* To track radiosondes launched by the Meterological service and add to a central database, [sondehub.org](https://tracker.sondehub.org)

## Frequencies and Modes

### Receive
* 70cm Amateur Band
* License exempt  433.05 - 434.79 MHz. All Modes, including  LoRa.
*  ??? 2m Amateur band, APRS mode
*  ??? License exempt 868 MHz
### Transmit
* License exempt  434.040â€“ 434.790 MHz 10 mW ERP 25 kHz bandwidth and 433.05 - 434.79 MHz 1mW ERP 25kHz bandwidth. All Modes, including  LoRa.
* No transmission in Amateur Bands
