# Things Network to HabHub Bridge



The Things Network to HabHub Bridge is needed to subscribe to the data on the Things Network which is comming through our tracker application from the Tracker devices. The data is then formatted and passed to HabHub for display on the HabHub map. The bridge should also store the data from the tracker and associated metadata about the receiving gateways for subsequent analysis
