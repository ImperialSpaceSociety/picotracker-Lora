    "# Created by Medad Rufus Newman on 19/03/2020\n",
    "# This program localises the position of a High altitude balloon without the use of the GPS by finding the \n",
    "# center of the minimum bounding circle of gateways that pick up the packets. The program then estimates altitude assuming the line of sight\n",
    "# horizon is the limit of the radio's range\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Occasionally, the GPS on the balloons fail, as it has done on ICSPACE19 but the radio is still transmitting.\n",
    "# We try to locate it based on where the radio transmissions are picked up. Note that ICSPACE is a floater balloon\n",
    "# designed to travel around the world.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# This program takes the csv data of a balloon flight, specifically ICSPACE19, from habitat by exporting as a CSV. \n",
    "# Then it matches the receive gateways with their location in a lookup table provided by The Things Network.\n",
