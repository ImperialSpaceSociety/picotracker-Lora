@par Description

This directory contains a set of source files that implements a simple demo of an end 
device also known as a LoRa Object connecting to a Lora Network. The LoRa Object can be 
   - either a STM32LXxx-Nucleo board and Lora Radio expansion board, optionnally a sensor board. 
   - or a B-L072Z-LRWAN1 (available soon)
By setting the LoRa Ids in comissioning.h file according to the LoRa Network requirements, 
the end device will send periodically the sensor data to the LoRa network.

@par Hardware and Software environment 


  - This example runs on STM32L053R8, STM32L073RZ, STM32L152RE and STM32L476RG devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with STMicroelectronics:
    NUCLEO-L053R8 RevC
    NUCLEO-L073RZ RevC
    NUCLEO-L152RE RevC
    NUCLEO-L476RG RevC	
    B-L072Z-LRWAN1 RevC
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32LXxx-Nucleo Set-up    
    - Connect the Nucleo board to your PC with a USB cable type A to mini-B 
      to ST-LINK connector (CN1 / CN7 on B-L072Z-LRWAN1).
    - Please ensure that the ST-LINK connector CN2 (CN8 on B-L072Z-LRWAN1) jumpers are fitted.

@par How to use it ? 
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
  - Open two Terminals, each connected the respective LoRa Object
  - Terminal Config = 115200, 8b, 1 stopbit, no parity, no flow control ( in src/vcom.c)
