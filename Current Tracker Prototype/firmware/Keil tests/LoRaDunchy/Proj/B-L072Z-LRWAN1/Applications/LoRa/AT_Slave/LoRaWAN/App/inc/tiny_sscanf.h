/**
 * @brief  Read formatted data from string
 *
 * Reads data from s and stores them according to parameter format into the
 * locations given by the additional arguments, as if scanf was used, but
 * reading from s instead of the standard input (stdin).
 *
 * The additional arguments should point to already allocated objects of the
 * type specified by their corresponding format specifier within the format string.
 *
 * @param  C string that the function processes as its source to retrieve the data.
 * @param  C string that contains a format string that follows the same specifications
 *         as format in scanf (see scanf for details).
 * @param  Depending on the format string, the function may expect a sequence of
 *         additional arguments, each containing a pointer to allocated storage
 *         where the interpretation of the extracted characters is stored with
 *         the appropriate type.
 *         There should be at least as many of these arguments as the number of
 *         values stored by the format specifiers. Additional arguments are
 *         ignored by the function.
 * @retval The number of items in the argument list successfully filled. This
 *         count can match the expected number of items or be less (even zero)
 *         in the case of a matching failure
 * @note   Current supported formats are %hx, %hhx, %ul, %d,...
