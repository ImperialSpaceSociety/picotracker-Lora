  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  This example shows how to query a Ublox module for its protocol version.

  Various modules have various protocol version. We've seen v18 up to v27. Depending
  on the protocol version there are different commands available. This is a handy
  way to predict which commands will or won't work.

  Leave NMEA parsing behind. Now you can simply ask the module for the datums you want!

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the GPS and a BlackBoard
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
